ISSUE: The plot is not showing ?
github performs a static render of the notebooks and it doesn't include the embedded HTML/JavaScript that makes up a plotly graph.
One nice option is to paste the link of the GitHub notebook into http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/, which will present a rich view of the notebook.
